## Description

- My motivation in this project was to create a clean, appealing portfolio site that is intuitive to navigate and will draw the attention of potential employers.
- I built this project to show the tech world my budding skills as a developer.
- This solves the problem of me not having any work on the internet.
- I learned ALOT: How to lay out a page from scratch, how to utilizer flexboxes, how to make images fit into boxes without stretching/distoring them, how to position the image, how to overlay text on the image, how to make links change color when you hover over them, how to link images to external websites, how to link the nav bar to scroll to certain parts of the page, how to make the website responsive to different devices/sizes.
